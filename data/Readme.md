# Birdtowers data

Current workflow

1. I'm maintaining list at Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uMvCzSq8WKneyaqtkRT9IYNU-Zi9d-7K9Y38eQCXd3Y/edit?usp=sharing (edit rights only by me)
~~2. copy master list to another sheet fg. Sheet 3 to fix column headers.~~
3. download table as tsv-file
4. import to QGIS as comma-separated vector file (EPSG:2393)
5. save as geojson file, projection wgs84.
6. (optionally check if valid geojson at geojson.io)
7. copy data file to application data folder.
